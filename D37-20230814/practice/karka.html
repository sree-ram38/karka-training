    <p>What is a paragraph? Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.<br><hr> In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
